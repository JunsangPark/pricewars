# A Simulation Platform for Dynamic Pricing Competition


This is the meta repository of the Price Wars platform that allows the simulation of a dynamic marketplace similar to online marketplaces like www.amazon.com. Using the simulation, one can test different pricing strategies and assess their performance compared to other pricing strategies.

The simulation is built using a microservice architecture and consists of multiple components representing important players in the simulation. Each component has its own repository and documentation and the links can be found in the following section.

For more information about the platform and publications, see the our chair's [project site](https://hpi.de/en/plattner/projects/price-wars-an-interactive-simulation-platform.html) on Dynamic Pricing under Competition.

On the master branch, this repository contains the docker-setup that allows running the simulation locally. On the [gh-pages](https://github.com/hpi-epic/pricewars/tree/gh-pages) branch one can find the [API specification](https://hpi-epic.github.io/pricewars/) of all components.

## Deployment

### Requirements

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  * If you are on Linux read [this](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/) for running docker as non-root user.
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Setup
Clone the repository and its subrepositories:

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:hpi-epic/pricewars.git
```

For the next step bring a fast internet line and some time.
This can take up to 30 minutes at the first-time setup.
Build docker images and containers with the following command.

```
docker-compose up --no-start
```

This command might not be available if you are on an older docker-compose version.
Use `docker-compose create` instead.

Once the containers are created, you can start the Price Wars platform:

```
docker-compose up
```

You can shut down the platform with `CTRL + C` or `docker-compose stop`.

Warning: There might be routing problems if the docker network overlaps with your local network.
If this is the case, change the ip address in `docker-compose.yml` under the `networks` entry.

### Run Pricewars

After starting the Pricewars platform with `docker-compose up`, it can be controlled with the [Management UI](http://localhost)

1. \[Optional] Configure available products in the [Config/Producer section](http://localhost/index.html#/config/producer)
2. Start the [Consumer](http://localhost/index.html#/config/consumer)
3. Merchants are trading products now. The [Dashboard](http://localhost/index.html#/dashboard/overview) shows graphs about sales, profits and more.


#### Cleaning up containers and existing state
Run the following commands to run the platform in a clean state.

```
docker-compose down
docker-compose up
```

#### Updating the Docker setup
First, stop your running containers.

```
docker-compose stop
```

Update repositories.
```
git pull
git submodule update
```

Rebuild all images that have changed:
```
docker-compose build
```

#### Help - My Docker Setup is not working as expected!

##### Some containers quit unexpectedly:
First, the analytics container is expected to be stopped after a short moment - it's just used to compile and export the flink jobs. If this is the only container not running, you're fine. In case any other container is not running, analyse the first container (except for analytics) that stopped.
- __Postgres__: Bring the platform in a clean state with `docker-compose down` and run it again.
- __Zookeeper / Kafka__: If you just stopped some older containers: Wait! There is a timeout for Zookeeper to notice that Kafka has been stopped (timestamp-based, so it works even if Zookeeper is not running). Bring the platform in a clean state with `docker-compose rm --stop` and run it again.
- __Others__: Try to read the logs or read on.

##### The command `docker-compose up` is hanging:
- Reset the containers and the network: `docker system prune` (and restart the Docker service).
- Terminate Docker and ensure, that all docker processes are stopped (especially the network service).
- Restart your computer and wait (even though it might be slow) for about five to ten minutes.
- Reset Docker to factory defaults (should be your last attempt, as this requires re-building of all images):
 - macOS: Click on "Preferences" > "Reset" > "Reset to factory defaults"

### Native
For details regarding the deployment of the component, we kindly refer to the deployment section of the microservice specific README.md file. The links can be found above.

## Benchmark Tool

You can run a benchmark on the Pricewars platform with the benchmark tool [benchmark.py](helper_scripts/benchmark.py).
This tool allows to run the platform in a given configuration for a specific time period.
Afterwards, results of this run are written to the output directory.

Firstly, install necessary Python libraries:
```
python3 -m pip install -r helper_scripts/requirements.txt
```

Example command:
```
python3 helper_scripts/benchmark.py --duration 30 --output <output directory> --merchants <merchant A command> <merchant B command>
```

This starts the whole platform and two merchants to compete against each other for 30 minutes.
As merchant start command you can use for example: `"python3 merchant/merchant.py --strategy Cheapest --port 5000"`
Run `python3 helper_scripts/benchmark.py --help` to see all arguments.

## Developement
There are different ways to develop the containerized marketplace services. These approaches have different trade-offs between setup time and time to run the platform with the new code.

#### Rebuilding the docker image
This method does not require any extra setup. The workflow is to modify code, then rebuild the docker images. Use the following commands:
```
docker-compose down
docker rmi <name_of_image>
```
On the next start of the platform, the new image will be built.

Rebuilding an image takes a few seconds up to over a minute depending on the service.

#### Mounting a volume
If rebuilding the image to too tedious, an alternative approach is mounting the executable (or source code) onto the docker container. This way, the program can be built locally and is used by the container on the next start.

The directory can be mounted in the `docker-compose.yml` file with the `volumes` option. 

#### Run service natively
It is possible to run a service natively. This removes the docker abstraction and is the fastest way to restart the service with a new version.

However, the service must be reconfigured to connect to the docker services and vice versa.
